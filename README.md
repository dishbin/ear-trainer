### description: 
All 12 semitones are played in a random order. After each tone you have to select the note you think it is from note select buttons. After all 12 notes have been played, a score is displayed, a log of which note was correct/incorrect, and you are asked if you would like to play again.

### technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### MVP goals: 
- a sequence of 12 semitones is arranged in a random order and played one at a time, waiting for user input in between tones
- after each tone is played, the user selects which tone they believe was played from a choice of 12 semitone buttons
- a 'replay tone' button is active for the user to replay the current tone again as many times as they would like 
- after the last tone is played, a percentage score is displayed along with a log of which notes were correct and incorrect
- after the score is displayed the user is able to press a 'play again' button and the game restarts with a new order

### stretch goals:
- different difficulty levels: adding other octaves for harder difficulty
- ability to manually select which semitones to generate from so you can tailor your exercise to your weakness notes
- infinite mode: tones are randomly generated endlessly and there is a running percentage displayed on the screen, can reset percentage to 0 at any time with a reset button
- chord mode: identify by multiple tones at once
- style so they actually look like keys (might be corny)
- keyboard input option
